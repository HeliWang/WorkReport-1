Virtium Inc. is a company that specializes in the assembly and programming of
NAND flash solid state drives. As one of the software engineers on the 
firmware team at Virtium Inc. I was mainly responsible for the simulation 
system used to test firmware code as it was developed, but without having 
to fatigue a physical SSD.

In the writing of this report, I have had no direct assistance from anyone. 
I do wish to thank Ho-Fan Kang, Trevor Chau, Lan Phan, and my excellent fellow
interns at Virtium for their exceptional support and assistance as we learned
about producing highly performant code in C++. To date, this has been the best
experience that I have had on a co-op term, due in large part to the excellent
people that I was working with.

\section{Summary}

The purpose of this report is to examine one of the design choices that I
had to make during this term. The simulation system that was used in place
of a real SSD was a separate process from the testing framework that was
used to interact with the drive. As such, an interprocess communication
library needed to be made to facilitate the interaction between the two processes.
Due to the volume and complexity of the tests, it was essential that this
library provide as high throughput as possible. This is the challenge that will
be examined throughout this report.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}


The problem of interprocess communication is not uncommon, and there
are several ways to implement it. The different implementations have
trade-offs, but they're all useful under the correct circumstances.

In order to understand which is the most ideal, the use-case and programming
environment needs to be examined first. In this case, both communicating
processes are written in C++, and both processes are running on the same
machine. Further, the host machine is running post-2007 Windows, although
we don't have any assurances about which release of Windows.

The requirements for this library are as follows: The two processes need to be able to send serialized data in both directions,
and the data streams can be anywhere from several bytes, to several gigabytes
at a time. The data is assured to be byte-aligned, but there are no assurances
about how many bytes will be transfered at a time. One process is assured to be initialized before the other communicating process begins.
The second process may be created and destroyed multiple times, and in that event,
the second process needs to be able to "pick up where it left off". Although
there are no hard constraints on throughput, the library must be as high throughput as possible.

With these constraints in mind, three common methods of interprocess communication
will be examined and evaluated to determine their viability for this application.

\section{Conclusions}
\section{Recommendations}

It seems obvious, but refactoring is esscencial to maintaining a usable and agile
codebase. To emphasize the importance that needs to be put into refactoring, the 
codebase for this project has been rewritten little-by-little about 3.3 times.
That is, for every line of code in the codebase, there were 3.3 lines added and deleted.
The general mantra that describes good refactoring is, "refactor early, refactor often".

\subsection{Design Patterns}

Design patterns are widely used methods of solving particular problems that can
come up very frequently in programming problems. It's good to have a large arsenal
of design patterns to call on when developing software. By using patterns that
are widely known, your code will be more readable to someone who has never seen
your code before, but has experience with design patterns. Knowlege of design
patterns can drastically increase the speed at which you arrive at solutions.
This is an area that was not adhered to as rigidly as the other proper coding practices,
but it is something that would have added a lot of value. The aggressive refactoring
resulted in a codebase that makes proper use of design patterns, but it would
have been better to have arrived at them initially.

\section{Challenges and Solutions}

\subsection{Section Structure}

In this section, the challenges that were faced will be introduced and
explained. The solutions that were implimented to solve these problems will
also be discussed. It's worth noting that when the software was being developed, 
the approach that was taken involved itemizing all of the challenges that were 
expected to come up so that all of them could be taken into consideration before 
writing a single line of code. In general, it's good to catch the challenges and
make sure that strategies for dealing with them can be incorporated nicely into
the code base. The earlier a challenge is spotted, the faster and more effectively
it can be solved.

\subsection{Code Testing}

In order to be certain that a software solution is relatively bug-free and stable,
it's often good practice to write unit tests and system tests to make sure that
the software operates as expected. In the case of an iOS application, this becomes
a very difficult thing to do. Most of the bugs that occur in iOS applications are
visual or system-behavioural. Since there is no straightforward way to write system
tests for user interfaces, none were written in this development process. Extensive 
manual testing was done prior to releases to make sure that no breaking bugs were
introduced to the live codebase. The lack of unit tests or automated system tests
meant that all of the other coding practices discussed in the previous section became
extremely important. The manual testing also needed to be extremely thorough to make
absolutely sure that no bugs were pushed to the general public. While somewhat frowned
upon, this method proved to be successful, however without almost obsessive adherence
to proper coding practices it likely would not have worked very well. As it stands, only
one release had a bug that was considered to be breaking, and was a relatively subtle
behavioural bug. In terms of stability, to date, there has never been a crash in a
production build.

\subsection{Object Serialization}

In order to serialize an object to save it to non-volitile memory,
serialization and deserialization methods need to be implimented for each class that
needs to be saved. There are 18 different classes within the codebase that need to
be serializable. This quickly became tedious. In order to solve this problem, a class
was created that utilizes some of the more powerful language features of objective-c.
In particular, objective-c allows classes to programatically reference the values
and the names of their member variables. By utilizing that feature, the class (called AutomagicalCoder)  is able
to cycle through all of its own member variables and store serialize them by encoding them
with their own string name as the key. In this way, any class that subclasses AutomagicalCoder
needn't worry about how to serialize itself, and instead just inherently knows how.

\subsection{User Interface Tools}

There are a lot of similarity between facets of a user interface. Particularly in this
application, there was often need to have a way of displaying a multitude of different
types of objects as cells in a table. Similarly, the behaviour invoked when the user
taps on these object cells with his/her finger is often (although not always) the same.
Both of these problems lent themselves well to the dispatcher design pattern. 

In the dispatcher pattern,
when it is necessary to do a similar action to many different types of data, instead of coding
each action separately, the data is sent to a "dispatcher" that looks through the data that
it knows how to handle, and decides accordingly which special actions to take depending on
the data. If the data is not of a known type, depending on the dispatcher, it is either correct
to take some default action, or simply to throw an error to let the programmer know that 
an unexpected piece of data was passed to the dispatcher. Objective-c lends itself to the 
dispatcher method, because of the language feature that allows a class to look through it's
own subclasses without the subclasses explicitly making themselves known to the parent class.

Without delving any deeper, a solid working knowledge of Apple's API is required to understand
most, if not all of the following paragraphs. An abbreviated explaination of Apple's API can 
be found in Appendix A.

In the case of displaying cells, the parent class (CustomViewCell) looks through it's subclass
and calls the canDisplayData method to query them about the data that it has been presented with.
This is shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Illustration of the Dispatcher Design Pattern}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{customViewCellFlowchart}
  \label{fig:Dispatcher Pattern}
\end{figure}

In this way, all that is necessary to fully define and display a list view is a list of the data
that should be displayed in the list. By dispatching to CustomViewCell, the particularities of
displaying each individual cell needn't be handled in any way by the tableViewDelegate. 

Another language feature involved in the simplification of the TableView interface provided
by Apple is that of calling methods by constructing their name through string manipulation.
If there's somthing that needs to occur when the user clicks on a cell, the TableViewDelegate
need only impliment a function named <CELLNAME>Handler. The method (if it exists) will be called
by the table view delegate whenever the cell is clicked on. In this way, the delegate can 
distinguish between cell clicks without needing to actually know the type of the cell or the
position of the cell (which is the traditional way that Apple intends for cell distinctions to
be made). 

By making all of these simplifying abstractions, the code length of the files defining
the behaviour of particular pages is vastly. One class in particular (OrderComboViewController)
has 4 lines of code in its header file and 23 lines of code in its implimentation. A screenshot
of this particular page is shown below. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \caption{Screenshot of the Order Combo Page}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{orderComboPage}
  \label{fig:Combo Page}
\end{figure}

The UITableViewDataSource for this page is simplified in a similar way. The class responsible
for the page contents (OrderComboRenderer) has 7 lines in its header file, and 37 in its implimentation.


The dispatcher pattern is a very powerful way of simplifying code.

\subsection{Client Version Management}

One of the complicating factors in designing any application is how various versions of the code will
interact with one another. The two possible modes of interaction in this case are communication with
the server, and loading data cached by an older version of the client code. 

\subsubsection{Server Communication}

If an old version of the client code were to try to interact with the server, the server's behavior
may have to be different than if an up to date client app were to attempt communications. The way that
this is solved is again by dispatching. As part of every communication with the server, the iOS application
transmits its version number. Based on the version number, the server dispatches the the response behaviour
to the appropriate version of the server code.

\subsubsection{Client Data Caching}

A more difficult complication is that of loading cached data. If the ipod/iphone user has an old version of the
app, saves some data, updates their app to the current version, and then attempts to load the cached data,
bad things can happen. Depending on the version of the app that was used to cache the data, the procedure
to update the data to be consistant with the current model is different. To solve this problem, a combination
of the dispatcher pattern and the fallthrough pattern was used. The first step in determining what to do
with the data being loaded is to check the version string. Luckillty, this problem was anticipated, and 
the cached data always contains a version string. Because this all needs to be done by AutomagicalCoder,
no actual knowledge of what these variables are is known explicitly at load time. To solve this, Automagical
Coder checks the version string, and if the version string is not the current version string, it checks for
the existance of a recovery routine for each of the variables that it determines that it needs to load.
if a recovery routine is implimented in the child class, AutomagicalCoder dispatches to the recovery 
routine by calling <VARIABLENAME>Recovery. The recovery routine uses the fallthrough pattern.

The fallthrough pattern uses a switch case structure where the case clauses do not contain a break statement.
In this way, the variable information will be updated in a cascade through all of the versions starting
at the version that was found on the disc all the way up to the present model. In this way, the only
thing that needs to be updated from version to version is the logic for moving the data from the version
immediately prior to the current version. Everything else just cascades through.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, by using the habits and patterns discussed in this report, the development project was a 
great success. From a technological view point, this product turned out great. It's stable, it looks good,
it is optimized enough that it feels smooth to interact with, and its code is very readable. 

The app can currently be downloaded from the app store, and is called "Pita Factory". As
not everyone has an iOS device, below are some screenshots of the finished product.

\appendix

\section{Apple API Abbreviated}

Appendix A is an abbreviated description of Apples's iOS API. It
will explain the general concepts behind displaying things on
an iOS device as well as the specific elements of the API that
are pertainant to this report.

As a general overview, there are views, models, and controllers.
The views represent the actual images that the user sees. The models
represent the data that is meant to be conveyed to the user. The
controllers encapsulate the ways that the user can interact with
the data. This is known as the model-view-controller design pattern
and is the design pattern that apple intends for programmers to use
when interacting with their API.

\subsection{UIViews}

UIView is the most basic class that is meant to be displayed to
the screen. A UIView has an area of the screen that it can manipulate
via its drawrect method. A UIView can also have an arbitrary number of 
subviews which draw themselves onto the parent UIView. There are 
many built-in subclasses of UIView that can accomodate most 
applications that a person might want to build.

Some notable subclasses of UIView are: UILabel, UIButton, UITableView
UIViewCell, and UIImageView.

\subsubsection{UITableView}

A UITableView is a view that can display any number of scrollable 
UIViewCells. The UITableView must be associated with a UITableViewDelegate
in order to define any interactive behaviour and must be associated
with a UITableViewDataSource in order to have any content. they will be
discussed more in the UIViewControllers and UIDataSources sections.

\subsubsection{UIViewCell}

A UIViewCell is a UIView that can be produced by a UITableViewDataSource.
The vanila UIViewCell can be used by itself as elements to populate a
UITableView and can be configured in several different default configurations
that can accomodate most data that a person might want to display reasonably
well. In cases where the vanila UIViewCell will not suffice, UIViewCell can
be subclassed to accomodate arbitrarily complex and unusual cells.

\subsection{UIViewControllers}

UIViewController is a class that is not intended to be used by itself, 
but rather to be subclassed to accomodate specific behaviour that
a programmer might intend for a view to have. View controllers are
often made to be the delegates of the view that they control so that
a view can request behavior from its view controller without actually
needing to know anything specific about the view controller. 

\subsubsection{UITableViewDelegate}

The most notable type of delegation that this report refers to is
that of the UITableViewDelegate. The UITableViewDelegate is responsible
for telling the UITableView what needs to happen upon the selection of
a cell at a particular position on the table. It's also responsible for 
letting the UITableView know the height that each cell is intended to
occupy.

\subsection{UIDataSources}

In general, the "model" part of the model-view-controller pattern is 
satisfied by a class that impliments a datasource interface defined for
the UIView that it is acting as the model for. This is not always
the case, and in cases where it isn't, the model will simply be a 
subclass of NSObject, which is a base class that everything derrives from
within the the Apple API.

\subsubsection{UITableViewDataSource}

A class that impliments the UITableViewDataSource interface will provide
a UITableView with the cells that the UITableView will populate itself with
as well as letting it know the number of cells that exist in the table,
the titles of the sections that make up the table.
